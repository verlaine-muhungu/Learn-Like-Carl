# Phase2:Linux skills,Ansible,Docker,Netconf/Yang 

Learning linux is paramount when it comes to learning network automation,the worldâ€™s top 500 fastest supercomputers all run on Linux.
there are more than 300 distributions in the world and ubuntu is the starting point,when i started my linux journey **Ubuntu** was the first then **Linux Mint**,**Raspbian**,**CentOs**,**Rocky Linux**.

Learning daily with hands-on experience gave me the taste to learn more,i was curious to discover more things in networking and the learning never stops ! 

Here are some resources to learn with more hands on experience:
